# word-count
c# windows console app to count the number of words in the data source

given a text file of indeterminite length I want to be able to read words and count the various instances of words that appear within that file


eg
"the thing is the best thing that the other thing has seen"

the 3
thing 3
is 1
best 1
..

etc

The text file included probably needs to be stripped of special characters etc, but I think this demonstrates the general idea of the steps involved
